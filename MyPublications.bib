@inproceedings{Hoebel2016deriving_footprints,
abstract = {The characterization of place and its representation in current Geographic Information System (GIS) has become a prominent research topic. This paper focus on places that are cognitive regions and presents a computational framework to derive the geographic footprint of these regions. The main idea is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to identify unique geographic features from User Generated Content (UGC) sources consisting of textual descriptions of places. These features are used to detect on a map an initial area that the descriptions refer to. A semantic representation of this area is extracted from a GIS and passed over to a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm that locates other areas according to semantic similarity. As a case study, we employ the proposed framework to derive the geographic footprint of the historic center of Vienna and validate the results by comparing},

@article{Fogliaroni2016qualitative_config_search,
abstract = {Current Geographic Information Systems (GIS) lack, to a large extent, support for spatial searches in which a user wants to find a configuration of objects described in qualitative terms. At the database level, these searches can be supported by providing new spatial operators that can capture the semantics of the qualitative spatial relations used in the description and by developing resolution strategies tailored for queries including these operators. We suggest a technical approach to include an open number of qualitative spatial relations in GIS and discuss a processing workflow leading from a qualitative spatial description to a database query and to the search result. We present and empirically evaluate a resolution strategy for these queries that is based on hypergraph matching and that exploits their semantic and structural characteristics. Finally, we envision some realizations of these searches and discuss challenges that relate to the cognitive aspect.},

@inproceedings{Hahn2016context,
abstract = {A natural language interface can improve human-computer interaction with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). A prerequisite for this is the mapping of natural language expressions onto spatial queries. Previous mapping approaches, using, for example, fuzzy sets, failed because of the flexible and context-dependent use of spatial terms. Context changes the interpretation drastically. For example, the spatial relation "near" can be mapped onto distances ranging anywhere from kilometers to centimeters. We present a context-enriched semiotic triangle that allows us to distinguish between multiple interpretations. As formalization we introduce the notation of contextualized concepts that is tied to one context. One concept inherits multiple contextualized concepts such that multiple interpretations can be distinguished. The interpretation for one contextualized concept corresponds to the intention of the spatial term, and is used as input for a spatial query. To demonstrate our computational model, a next generation GIS is envisioned that maps the spatial relation "near" to spatial queries differently according to the influencing context.},

abstract = {This paper introduces and formalizes a frame of reference for projective relations in 3D space that can be used to model human visual perception. While in 2D space visibility information can be derived from the concept of collinearity (thus, as ternary relations), in 3D space it can be derived from coplanarity, which calls for quaternary relations. Yet, we can retain ternary relations by anchoring our frame to an ubiquitous reference element: a general sense of vertical direction that, on Earth, can be the expression of gravity force or, in other cases, of the asymmetries of an autonomous agent, either human or robotic, that is, its vertical axis. Based on these observations, the presented frame of reference can be used to model projective and visibility information as ternary relations. Granularity and complexity of the models can be adjusted: we present two differently detailed realizations and discuss possible applications in Geographic Information Systems.},

abstract = {Visibility is the quality of an entity of being visible (i.e., perceivable to the human eye) and the expression of the predominant sense through which the majority of humans cognize space: the sense of sight. From a purely physical perspective, an entity is perceivable to the human eye if it emanates electromagnetic radiations with a wavelength comprised between approximately 400 and 700 nanometers—the so–called visible spectrum. While such a physical property assures the potentiality for an entity to be seen by a human observer, it is not enough to assure that an entity is actually seen. Indeed, the visibility of an entity also depends on the spatial dislocation of the entity itself with respect to a person (more generally another entity) observing a scene. In order to have full visibility on an entity, an observer must have a clear line of sight to the entity; that is, no third opaque entity should lie in between the observer and the observed entity. In this respect, visibility is a derivation of projective relations (Billen and Clementini, 2004, 2005, 2006) among three objects: an observed object (A) is visible from an observer (B) if it does not fall in the cone projected from an obstacle (C) and generated from the half–lines going from B to C.},

@inproceedings{Hoebel2015urban_settings,
abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a growing production of Volunteer Geographic Information (VGI). This led to the general availability of semantically rich datasets, allowing for novel ways to understand, analyze or generalize urban areas. This paper presents an approach that exploits this semantic richness to extract urban settings, i.e., conceptually–uniform geographic areas with respect to certain activities. We argue that urban settings are a more accurate way of generalizing cities, since it more closely models human sense–making of urban spaces. To this end, we formalized and implemented a semantic region growing algorithm—a modification of a standard image segmentation procedure. To evaluate our approach, shopping areas of two European capital cities (Vienna and London) were extracted from an OpenStreetMap dataset. Finally, we explored the use of our approach to search for urban settings (e.g., shopping areas) in one city, that are similar to a setting in another.},

A legitimate path of argumentation is that 2D systems fail to communicate complex legal situations correctly. Also, additional arguments can help to strengthen the position of 3D cadastres and provide support from other professions and social groups. The paper is based on a newly developed model for 3D visibility. We discuss the model and how it can be used for two different application areas. The first is the assessment of property value, where the visibility or invisibility of specific objects can have a big impact. The other example is spatial planning. Spatial planning shall guarantee that cities are working economically and socially, that space is not wasted, and that the planned environment meets cognitive requirements. For example, evidences in spatial cognition show that visibility of landmarks is an important topic for tourism and navigation and should thus be addressed.},

abstract = {Spatial planning shall guarantee that the limited resource land is used efficiently. One problem connected to such a task is the control of the result's quality. In case of spatial planning the question is, whether the proposed usage and the legal framework requirements actually fit the needs of the society. A problem in such an assessment is the time frame. Planning of concrete situations, e.g., of a large bus stop, is implemented quickly and thus feedback can be collected by the people who were doing the planning. The results on strategic development plans, however, may take decades to become visible and thus it is difficult to learn from mistakes or find examples where the planning was successfully implemented. In this paper we propose using the cadastre as a source for feedback on spatial planning. The idea is that the cadastre contains all data to show the effects of spatial planning. However, it does so in a way that is not supporting any feedback. The cadastral data must be rearranged in order to extract the effects of spatial planning. We discuss the information hidden in the cadastral data sets and show some directions for implementation issues.},

@phdthesis{FoglQual2012,
abstract = {For a long time survey, management, and provision of geographic information in Geographic Information Systems (gis) have mainly had an authoritative nature. Today the trend is changing and such an authoritative geographic information source is now accompanied by a public and freely available one which is usually referred to as Volunteered Geographic Information (vgi). Actually, the term vgi does not refer only to the mere geographic information, but, more generally, to the whole process which assumes the engagement of volunteers to collect and maintain such information in freely accessible gis. The quick spread of vgi gives new relevance to a well-known challenge: developing new methods and techniques to ease down the interaction between users and gis. Indeed, in spite of continuous improvements, gis mainly provide interfaces tailored for experts, denying the casual user—usually a non-expert—the possibility to access vgi information. One main obstacle resides in the different ways gis and humans deal with spatial information: gis mainly encode spatial information in a quantitative format, whereas human beings typically prefer a qualitative and relational approach. For example, we use expressions like “the lake is to the right-hand side of the wood” or “is there a supermarket close to the university?” which qualitatively locate a spatial entity with respect to another. Nowadays, such a gap in representation has to be plugged by the user, who has to learn about the system structure and to encode his requests in a form suitable to the system. Contrarily, enabling gis to explicitly deal with qualitative spatial information allows for shifting the translation effort to the system side. Thus, to facilitate the interaction with human beings, gis have to be enhanced with tools for efficiently handling qualitative spatial information. The work presented in this thesis addresses the problem of enabling Qualitative Spatial Configuration Queries (qscqs) in gis. A qscq is a spatial database query which allows for an automatic mapping of spatial descriptions produced by humans: A user naturally expresses his request of spatial information by drawing a sketch map or producing a verbal description. The qualitative information conveyed by such descriptions is automatically extracted and encoded into a qscq. The focus of this work is on two main challenges: First, the development of a framework that allows for managing in a spatial database the variety of spatial aspects that might be enclosed in a spatial description produced by a human. Second, the conception of Qualitative Spatial Access Methods (qsams): algorithms and data structures tailored for efficiently solving qscqs. The main objective of a qsam is that of countering the exponential explosion in terms of storage space—occurring when switching from a quantitative to a qualitative spatial representation—while keeping query response time acceptable.},

@inproceedings{DeFelice10EnvLearn,
abstract = {We investigate environmental learning and navigation capabilities based on qualitative observations and formal spatial reasoning. Our approach is based on previous work in the area of qualitative navigation (Davis 1983, Schlieder 1993, Wagner et al. 2004) in which a classification of perceptions into qualitative categories is used to derive a decomposition of space leading to a graph-based representation of the environment called topological map. As described in Kuipers (2000), the use of topological map is motivated by a cognitively inspired approach to robot navigation that requires to execute a sequence of local behaviors in order to reach a target position. In Fogliaroni et al. (2009) we described a novel qualitative approach able to explore, navigate and build a topological map of an unknown environment based on a model of visibility between extended objects. We now extend the visibility model into a qualitative spatial calculus to apply qualitative spatial reasoning techniques (Cohn and Hazarika 2001). This allows us to employ formal spatial reasoning to improve map learning and navigation.},

@inproceedings{Fogliaroni09qualitative,
abstract = {In this paper we describe a model for navigation of an autonomous agent in which localization, path planning, and locomotion is performed in a qualitative manner instead of relying on exact coordinates. Our approach is grounded in a decomposition of navigable space based on a novel model of visibility and occlusion relations between extended objects for agents with very limited sensor abilities. A graph representation reflecting the adjacency between the regions of the decomposition is used as a topological map of the environment. The visibility-based representation can be constructed autonomously by the agent and navigation can be performed by simple reactive navigation behaviors. Moreover, the representation is well-qualified to be shared between multiple agents.},

abstract = {The visibility concept is related to many application fields such as robot navigation, computer graphics and telecommunication systems. In this paper we propose a new qualitative model for visibility relations based on properties of the projective space. Within the model we present a set of seven ternary relations among convex regions. Our model is capable to determine the visibility relation between a primary object A with the respect to a ``region of view'' C and an obstacle B. We developed the reasoning system, which allows the prediction of ternary relations between specific regions.},
